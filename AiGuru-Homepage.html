            <P>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the development of computer systems that can mimic human intelligence by performing tasks like understanding language, recognizing patterns, making decisions, and learning from data. There are two main types: Narrow AI, which is specialized for specific tasks (e.g., voice assistants), and General AI (AGI), a theoretical form with human-like intelligence. AI technologies, including machine learning and deep learning, are being applied across various industries, promising efficiency and innovation, but they also raise important ethical and societal concerns such as privacy and bias.</P>

            <div class="sec-col">
                <h3>Blog2</h3>
                <p>Artificial Intelligence is a new technology in the field of computer science. “Artificial” means man-made that is not natural and “Intelligence” refers to the ability to think and make decisions. Therefore, we can say that making machines like computers to take their own decisions is Artificial Intelligence. This could be possible using various computer programming and codes.

                    In other words, Artificial Intelligence or AI is a field that makes computers to behave like humans and make decisions on their own. Machine learning and natural language processing are all part of Artificial Intelligence. Some advanced hardware and software along with the high-level programming languages are used in AI applications.</p>

                <h3>Blog3</h3>
                <p>Artificial Intelligence is the wide branch of computer science. It deals with developing smart machines that can operate without human interaction. Today we can think of a machine that can work according to our needs without providing instructions.

                    Artificial Intelligence can be used in video games, mobile phones, cars, surveillance, etc.
                    
                    Many famous social platforms like Google, Facebook and many more use Artificial Intelligence. The recommendation in Google or any other site uses AI. Google assistance and Siri in iPhone is a virtual assistance program which is an example of Artificial Intelligence.</p>

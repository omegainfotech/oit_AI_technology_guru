                <P>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the development of computer systems that can mimic human intelligence
                    by performing tasks like understanding language, recognizing patterns, making decisions, and
                    learning from data. There are two main types: Narrow AI, which is specialized for specific tasks
                    (e.g., voice assistants), and General AI (AGI), a theoretical form with human-like intelligence. AI
                    technologies, including machine learning and deep learning, are being applied across various
                    industries, promising efficiency and innovation, but they also raise important ethical and societal
                    concerns such as privacy and bias.
                    <br><br>AI enables technical systems to perceive their environment, deal with what they perceive,
                    solve
                    problems and act to achieve a specific goal. The computer receives data - already prepared or
                    gathered through its own sensors such as a camera - processes it and responds

                <p>Certainly! In the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), a diverse set of technologies and techniques
                    play crucial roles in enabling machines to perform intelligent tasks.</p>
                <p>1. Machine Learning (ML): ML algorithms empower systems to learn from data, making predictions or
                    decisions without explicit programming.</p>
                <p>2. Deep Learning: A subset of ML, deep learning employs artificial neural networks to model intricate
                    patterns and representations in data. It is often used for tasks like image and speech recognition,
                    natural language understanding, and autonomous driving.</p>
                <p>3. Natural Language Processing (NLP): NLP focuses on teaching computers to comprehend and interact
                    with human language. It's used in chatbots, sentiment analysis, language translation, and text
                    generation.</p>

                        <p>Governments and business believe that, while AI has enormous potential to assist the world,
                            effective safeguards are needed to prevent hazards. The US and UK governments, the European
                            Union, the OECD, the G7 (through the Hiroshima AI project), and others have already made
                            significant contributions to these efforts. The Frontier Model Forum will create an advisory
                            board in the upcoming months that will reflect a variety of backgrounds and viewpoints and
                            assist in guiding its strategy and goals.

                        <p>One of the most significant advantages of integrating AI into education is its ability to
                            provide personalized learning experiences. AI-powered systems can analyze each student's
                            unique learning patterns, strengths, weaknesses, and preferences. This data allows educators
                            to tailor learning materials and activities to meet individual students' needs. For example,
                            adaptive learning platforms can dynamically adjust the difficulty of questions or recommend
                            additional resources based on a student's performance. This level of personalization not
                            only enhances engagement but also promotes a deeper understanding of the subject matter.</p>

                            technological landscape. As artificial intelligence continues to play an increasingly
                            prominent role in various aspects of society, including healthcare, finance, and autonomous
                            systems, ensuring responsible and ethical AI development and deployment is paramount. 
                             By advancing AI governance, we
                            pave the way for a future where AI technologies can be harnessed for the benefit of all

                            profound challenges centered on automation, centralization, and scale. As AI systems

                            and accountability becomes paramount. Addressing these ethical
                            dilemmas demands a collective effort from technology developers, policymakers, and society
                            at large to ensure that AI's power is wielded responsibly and aligns with ethical
                            principles, promoting a future where AI benefits are shared equitably and power remains

                        <p>Automatic speech recognition (ASR) technology has made conversations more accessible with
                            live captions in remote conferencing software, mobile applications, and head-worn displays.
                            However, to maintain real-time responsiveness, live caption systems often display interim
                            predictions that are updated as new utterances are received. This can cause text instability
                            (a “flicker” where previously displayed text is updated, shown in the captions on the left
                            in the video below), which can impair users' reading experience due to distraction, fatigue,
                            and difficulty following the conversation.</p>

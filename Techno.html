                    learning for complex pattern recognition, natural language processing for language understanding,
                    computer vision for visual interpretation, and robotics for physical interaction, among others.

                    artificial intelligence (AI).
                    Most AI examples you hear about today rely largely on deep learning and natural language processing,
                    from chess-playing computers to self-driving automobiles.
                    Computers may be trained to do certain jobs by analyzing massive volumes of data and identifying
                    patterns in the data using these methods.

                <p class="para">Machine Learning (ML) is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that focuses on the development
                    of algorithms and statistical models that enable computer systems to improve their performance on a
                    specific task through learning from data, without being explicitly programmed. The core idea of
                    machine learning is to use data to identify patterns, make predictions, or make decisions, often in
                    situations where human programming would be impractical or too complex.</p>
                <img class="img2-1-2" src="images/tec1-1.jpg" alt="aiimage">
                <p class="para">1. Training Data: Machine learning models are trained on a dataset containing input examples
                    (features) and their corresponding desired outcomes (labels or targets). This data is used to teach
                    the model how to make predictions or classifications.
                    <br>
                    <br>


                    2. Algorithms: ML algorithms are mathematical procedures that process the training data to learn
                    patterns and relationships. These algorithms can be categorized into various types, including
                    supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning, each suited to different
                    tasks.
                    <br><br>

                    3. Features: Features are the characteristics or attributes of the data that are used as input to
                    the
                    machine learning model. Feature engineering involves selecting, transforming, or creating relevant
                    features to improve model performance.
                    <br><br>

                    4. Model Training: During training, the ML model adjusts its internal parameters based on the
                    training
                    data to minimize errors or discrepancies between its predictions and the actual outcomes. This
                    process continues iteratively until the model achieves acceptable performance.
                    <br><br>

                    5. Validation and Testing: After training, the model's performance is evaluated using separate
                    datasets
                    called validation and testing sets to ensure it can generalize well to unseen data and avoid
                    overfitting (performing well on training data but poorly on new data).
                    <br> <br>

                    4. Supervised Learning: In supervised learning, models are trained on labeled data, where the
                    desired
                    outcomes are provided. This type of ML is used for tasks such as classification (e.g., spam
                    detection) and regression (e.g., predicting house prices).
                    <br><br>

                    5. Unsupervised Learning: Unsupervised learning deals with unlabeled data and seeks to discover
                    patterns, clusters, or hidden structures within the data. Examples include clustering and
                    dimensionality reduction techniques.

                    learn hierarchical representations of information. Deep learning excels in tasks like image and
                    speech recognition, natural language processing, and autonomous systems, and it has revolutionized
                    fields such as computer vision and audio processing. Its remarkable ability to automatically
                    discover intricate features in vast datasets has led to groundbreaking advancements in AI, but it
